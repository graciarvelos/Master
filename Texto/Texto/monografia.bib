abstract = {Water adsorption at metal surfaces is governed by a subtle balance between water–water hydrogen bonding and water–metal interactions, which together determine the stability of the water structures formed. This review describes recent experimental and theoretical studies of water and OH/water coadsorption on well-defined single crystal metal surfaces, systems that have seen an upsurge in interest as new results modify our picture of how water adsorbs on metal surfaces. These results reveal that the simple, conventional ice ‘bilayer’ description of water adsorption, in which water is only marginally distorted from its bulk ice arrangement, is inadequate to describe wetting. Instead, optimisation of the water–metal interaction distorts the local hydrogen bonding geometry of water monolayers significantly from that of bulk ice, with consequent effects on the lateral size and geometry of ice clusters, on the structure of water monolayers and on the wetting of first layer water and growth of ice multilayers. Here we compare adsorption across different metal surfaces, review evidence for the formation of mixed OH/H2O co-adsorption structures and highlight issues that remain uncertain.}

abstract  ="Understanding the local structure of water at the interfaces of metallic electrodes is a key issue in aqueous-based electrochemistry. Nevertheless a realistic simulation of such a setup is challenging{,} particularly when the electrodes are maintained at different potentials. To correctly compute the effect of an external bias potential applied to truly semi-infinite surfaces{,} we combine Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function (NEGF) methods. This framework allows for the out-of-equilibrium calculation of forces and dynamics{,} and directly correlates to the chemical potential of the electrodes{,} which is introduced experimentally. In this work{,} we apply this methodology to study the electronic properties and atomic forces of a water molecule at the interface of a gold surface. We find that the water molecule tends to align its dipole moment with the electric field{,} and it is either repelled or attracted to the metal depending on the sign and magnitude of the applied bias{,} in an asymmetric fashion."}

Advances in density functional theory mean it is now possible to describe catalytic reactions at surfaces with the detail and accuracy required for computational results to compare favourably with experiments. Theoretical methods can be used to describe surface chemical reactions in detail and to understand variations in catalytic activity from one catalyst to another. Here, we review the first steps towards using computational methods to design new catalysts. Examples include screening for catalysts with increased activity and catalysts with improved selectivity. We discuss how, in the future, such methods may be used to engineer the electronic structure of the active surface by changing its composition and structure.},

	abstract = {The hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol on Pd(111), Cu(111) and Pt(111) is studied with both standard Density Functional Theory (DFT)-GGA functionals and with van der Waals-corrected density functionals. VdW-DF functionals, including optPBE, optB88, optB86b, and Grimme's method, are used to optimize the adsorption configurations of furfural, furfuryl alcohol, and related intermediates resulting from hydrogenation of furfural, and the results are compared to corresponding values determined with GGA functionals, including PW91 and PBE. On Pd(111) and Pt(111), the adsorption geometries of the intermediates are not noticeably different between the two classes of functionals, while on Cu(111), modest changes are seen in both the perpendicular distance and the orientation of the aromatic ring with respect to the planar surface. In general, the binding energies increase substantially in magnitude as a result of van der Waals contributions on all metals. In contrast, however, dispersion effects on the kinetics of hydrogenation are relatively small. It is found that activation barriers are not significantly affected by the inclusion of dispersion effects, and a Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship developed solely from PW91 calculations on Pd(111) is capable of describing corresponding results on Cu(111) and Pt(111), even when the dispersion effects are included. Finally, the reaction energies and barriers derived from the dispersion-corrected and pure GGA calculations are used to plot simple potential energy profiles for furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol on the three considered metals, and an approximately constant downshift of the energetics due to the dispersion corrections is observed.}

@Article{HFversusDFT,
	abstract = {We compare two different approaches to investigations of many-electron systems. The first is the Hartree–Fock (HF) method and the second is the Density Functional Theory (DFT). Overview of the main features and peculiar properties of the HF method are presented. A way to realize the HF method within the Kohn–Sham (KS) approach of the DFT is discussed. We show that this is impossible without including a specific correlation energy, which is defined by the difference between the sum of the kinetic and exchange energies of a system considered within KS and HF, respectively. It is the nonlocal exchange potential entering the HF equations that generates this correlation energy. We show that the total correlation energy of a finite electron system, which has to include this correlation energy, cannot be obtained from considerations of uniform electron systems. The single-particle excitation spectrum of many-electron systems is related to the eigenvalues of the corresponding KS equations. We demonstrate that this spectrum does not coincide in general with the eigenvalues of KS or HF equations.},

These can be used in connexion with the molecular orbital method, or localized bond method, or the general method of treating linear combinations of many Slater determinants by the variational procedure. This general method of obtaining a sequence of solutions converging to the accurate solution is examined. It is shown that the only obstacle to the evaluation of wave functions of any required degree of accuracy is the labour of computation.

pseudopotentials and a flexible,  numerical
linear combination of atomic orbitals basis set,

Exchange and correlation are treated with the local spin density
or generalized gradient approximations. The basis functions and
the electron density are projected on a real-space grid, in
order to calculate the Hartree and  exchange-correlation 
potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that
scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified
energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal
wavefunctions and the same energy and density  as the Kohn-Sham
energy functional, without the need for an explicit
orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like
electron wavefunctions   allows the computation time and memory
required to minimize  the energy to also scale linearly with
the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated
efficiently and accurately,  thus allowing structural relaxation
and molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Pseudopotential-based Density-Functional Theory (DFT) permits the calculation of material properties with a modest computational effort, besides an acknowledged tradeoff of generating and testing pseudopotentials that reproduce established benchmark structural and electronic properties. To facilitate the needed benchmarking process, here we present a pragmatic method to optimize pseudopotentials for arbitrary materials directly from eigenvalue sets consistent with all-electron results. This method thus represents a much needed pragmatic route for the creation and assessment of sensitive pseudopotentials for DFT calculations that has been exemplified within the context of the SIESTA code. Comprehensive optimized pseudopotentials, basis sets, and lattice parameters are provided for twenty chemical elements in the bulk, and for both LDA and GGA exchange–correlation potentials. This method helps addressing the following issues: (i) the electronic dispersion and structural properties for Ge, Pd, Pt, Au, Ag, and Ta better agree with respect to all-electron results now, (ii) we provide the expected metallic behavior of Sn in the bulk – which comes out semiconducting when using available pseudopotentials, (iii) we create a validated pseudopotential for LDA-tungsten, and (iv) we create the first Bi pseudopotential for SIESTA that reproduces well-known electron and hole pockets at the L and T points. We investigated the transferability of these pseudopotentials and basis sets, and predict a new phase for two-dimensional tin as well.},

Most such properties are inaccessible to direct measurements, but are key to understanding the physics of the multilayers. They are contained within first-principles electronic structure computations but are buried within the vast amount of quantitative information those computations generate. Thus far, they have been extracted from the numerical data by heuristic nanosmoothing procedures which do not necessarily provide results independent of the smoothing process. In the present paper we develop the theory of nanosmoothing, establishing procedures for both unpolarized and polarized systems which yield interfacial charge and dipole densities and band offsets invariant to the details of the smoothing procedures when the criteria we have established are met. We show also that dipolar charge densities, i.e. the densities of charge transferred across the interface, and screening lengths are not invariant. We illustrate our procedure with a toy model in which real, transversely averaged charge densities are replaced by sums of Gaussians.},

This is mainly due to the unquestionable advantage of weak spin–orbit and hyperfine interactions in organic molecules, which leads to the possibility of preserving spin-coherence over times and distances much longer than in conventional metals or semiconductors. Here we demonstrate theoretically that organic spin valves, obtained by sandwiching an organic molecule between magnetic contacts, can show a large bias-dependent magnetoresistance and that this can be engineered by an appropriate choice of molecules and anchoring groups. Our results, obtained through a combination of state-of-the-art non-equilibrium transport methods and density functional theory, show that although the magnitude of the effect varies with the details of the molecule, large magnetoresistance can be found both in the tunnelling and the metallic limit.},

The role of the exchange and correlation density functional in the characterization of both the hydrogen bond and the water–metal interaction is analyzed in detail. The effect of non local correlations using the van der Waals density functional proposed by Dion et al. [M. Dion{,} H. Rydberg{,} E. Schröder{,} D. C. Langreth and B. I. Lundqvist{,} Phys. Rev. Lett.{,} 2004{,} 92{,} 246401] is also studied. We conclude that the choice of this potential is critical in determining the cohesive energy of water–metal complexes. We show that the interaction between water molecules and the metal surface is as sensitive to the density functional choice as hydrogen bonds between water molecules are. The reason for this is that the two interactions are very similar in nature. We make a detailed analogy between the water–water bond in the water dimer and the water–Pd bond at the Pd 〈111〉 surface. Our results show a strong similarity between these two interactions and based on this we describe the water–Pd bond as a hydrogen bond type interaction. These results demonstrate the need to obtain an accurate and reliable representation of the hydrogen bond interaction in density functional theory."}

Mean-field and empirical models of the electrical double layer (EDL) that forms in response to an applied potential do not capture the heterogeneity that polarizable{,} liquid-phase water molecules engender. To illustrate the inhomogeneous nature of the electrochemical interface{,} Born–Oppenheimer ab initio molecular dynamics calculations of electrified Au(111) slabs interfaced with liquid water were performed using a combined explicit–implicit solvent approach. The excess charges localized on the model electrode were held constant and the electrode potentials were computed at frequent simulation times. The electrode potential in each trajectory fluctuated with changes in the atomic structure{,} and the trajectory-averaged potentials converged and yielded a physically reasonable differential capacitance for the system. The effects of the average applied voltages{,} both positive and negative{,} on the structural{,} hydrogen bonding{,} dynamical{,} and vibrational properties of water were characterized and compared to literature where applicable. Controlled-potential simulations of the interfacial solvent dynamics provide a framework for further investigation of more complex or reactive species in the EDL and broadly for understanding electrochemical interfaces in situ."}

  abstract = {The adsorption, diffusion, and clustering of water molecules on a Pd(111) surface were studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. At 40 kelvin, low-coverage water adsorbs in the form of isolated molecules, which diffuse by hopping to nearest neighbor sites. Upon collision, they form first dimers, then trimers, tetramers, and so on. The mobility of these species increased by several orders of magnitude when dimers, trimers, and tetramers formed, and decreased again when the cluster contained five or more molecules. Cyclic hexamers were found to be particularly stable. They grow with further exposure to form a commensurate hexagonal honeycomb structure relative to the Pd(111) substrate. These observations illustrate the change in relative strength between intermolecular hydrogen bonds and molecule-substrate bonds as a function of water cluster size, the key property that determines the wetting properties of materials.},

The metal surface is considered as a chemically (or redox) modified electrode, with equilibrated, low energy, surface gold atoms functioning as a relatively inert support and low coverage, high energy, protruding gold atoms (or minute clusters of same) functioning as electrocatalytic redox mediators. The protruding atoms are viewed as surface active sites and the complex electrocatalytic behaviour is attributed to the basic instability of the mediators, the diversity (and poor control) of same, and the acid/base (or hydrolysis) behaviour of the oxidized states of the mediators. It is assumed that major advances in the application of gold in the heterogeneous catalysis of gas phase reactions will be accompanied by similar advances in the use of gold in the electrocatalysis area; however, this will require considerable work of both a practical and theoretical nature.},

  abstract = {In electrochemistry, Pourbaix diagrams also known as potential-pH diagrams map out the regions of stability of metals as well as the regions of possible existence of stable compounds. The stable states other than the metallic one are macroscopic compounds, typically oxides and hydroxides, or their hydrated forms. Yet, several noble metals possess the ability to form thin surface oxides, to adsorb anions, and to adsorb or to absorb hydrogen in the potential range of water stability. Palladium is a unique noble metal owing to its ability to adsorbed and to absorb H, as well as to form compact and stable surface oxides. Anodic polarization of Pd results in the formation of a surface oxide. Thus, a great majority of anodic electrode processes takes place not at a metallic surface but at a surface covered with an oxide layer. Although thin surface oxides reveal metallic conductivity, the presence of O-containing species affects the electron transfer kinetics and the adsorption behaviour of reactants, intermediates, and products. Thus, the electrocatalytic properties of Pd electrodes, and the mechanism and kinetics of the reaction under consideration are strongly affected by the oxide layer, its thickness, chemical composition (Pd oxidation state and nature of O-containing species) and 3D structure, degree of oxide hydration, and electronic properties. This contribution presents an overview of the current understanding of electro-oxidation of Pd in aqueous acidic and basic electrolytes. In particular, it describes the formation of Pd oxides under various experimental conditions and discusses their chemical and physical nature. It examines the reduction of O-containing species present on Pd electrodes as well as the adsorption of anions and cations. Since Pd can undergo electrodissolution that results in material loss, the process is analyzed in relation to experimental parameters. Recent developments in the electrochemical behaviour of single-crystal Pd electrodes are discussed. Electrochemical parameters such as the potential of zero charge, potential of zero total charge and potential of zero free charge are of importance to the structure of the electric double layer; thus, their values are discussed in relation to the absence/presence of Pd surface oxides. Finally, various experimental procedures commonly used to determine the real surface area of Pd electrodes are outlined and compared.},

The contribution of palladium electrodissolution in the voltammogram changes in going from the first potential scan to the following ones. This contribution also depends on the characteristics of the potential perturbation programme applied to the electrode. Different potential ranges associated with the formation of soluble palladium(II) are distinguished, which correlate with those corresponding to electrochemical reactions already established. The results are explained through a competitive reaction pathway involving the formation of Pd(OH) and Pd(OH)+ intermediate species.

Their diameters were estimated to be 2–10 nm by means of a high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Properties of Pd/GC electrodes in hydrogen adsorption were characterised by cyclic voltammetry. Adsorption strength of hydrogen species on the Pd particles of Pd/GC did not depend on the particle size, whereas amounts of the adsorbed hydrogen species and the absorbed ones into the Pd particles were dependent. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) clearly revealed that the energy level of Pd 3d electron band increased with a decrease in the Pd particle size.},

Gaining such insight experimentally under electrochemical conditions is a formidable task. The potential-dependent structure of a subpopulation of interfacial water with one OH group pointing towards a gold working electrode is characterized using interface specific vibrational spectroscopy in a thin film electrochemical cell. Such free-OH groups are the molecular level observable of an extended hydrophobic interface. This free-OH interacts only weakly with the Au surface at all potentials, has an orientational distribution that narrows approaching the potential of zero charge, and disappears on oxidation of the gold electrode.},

  abstract = {First-principles predictions play an important role in understanding chemistry at the electrochemical interface. Electronic structure calculations are straightforward for vacuum interfaces, but do not easily account for the interfacial fields and solvation that fundamentally change the nature of electrochemical reactions. Prevalent techniques for first-principles prediction of electrochemical processes range from expensive explicit solvation using ab initio molecular dynamics, through a hierarchy of continuum solvation techniques, to neglecting solvation and interfacial field effects entirely. Currently, no single approach reliably captures all relevant effects of the electrochemical double layer in first-principles calculations. This review systematically lays out the relation between all major approaches to first-principles electrochemistry, including the key approximations and their consequences for accuracy and computational cost. Focusing on ab initio methods for thermodynamic properties of aqueous interfaces, we first outline general considerations for modeling electrochemical interfaces, including solvent and electrolyte dynamics and electrification. We then present the specifics of various explicit and implicit models of the solvent and electrolyte. Finally, we discuss the compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy, and identify key outstanding challenges and future opportunities in the wide range of techniques for first-principles electrochemistry.},

  abstract = {Electrified metal-water interfaces are a key feature in many devices and processes, finding applications in a variety of fields, including corrosion, photo/electrocatalysis, and energy. For over 200 years after Faraday established his ground-breaking law, electrochemistry has been subject to intense research, due to its broad applications and interdisciplinary nature. However, it remains an open challenge to provide a comprehensive description of molecular scale structure and processes at electrified interfaces in electrochemical conditions. In this review, we highlight the most recent advancements in the application of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) to study metal-water interfaces, noting how this work aligns with experimental and other theoretical models. We show how AIMD simulations have unveiled new perspectives on the crucial impact of water on determining surface potentials, the chemistry of surface adsorbates, and capacitive response under electrochemical conditions. We highlight how this work aligns with experimental and other simplified theoretical models.},

This database contains the anisotropic work functions of more than 100 polymorphs of about 72 elements and up to a maximum Miller index of two and three for non-cubic and cubic crystals, respectively. The database has been rigorously validated against previous experimental and computational data where available. We also propose a weighted work function based on the Wulff shape that can be compared to measurements from polycrystalline specimens, and show that this weighted work function can be modeled empirically using simple atomic parameters. Furthermore, for the first time, we were able to analyze simple bond breaking rules for metallic systems beyond a maximum Miller index of one, allowing for a more generalized investigation of work function anisotropy.}
